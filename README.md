# zero.core
The front controller for the Zero Framework

# Runtime Options:

- Minimal 
    Minimal will use MUFASA to load your class and call the function, nothing else.

- Simple Frame 
    Simple Frame will load up some other useful stuff and will also automagically insert the header and footer
    Of course it isn't perfectly "Simple" it is genuinely easy to get going with. 

- Zero.JS 
    Acts as a client-side zero framework for rapid prototyping - but also enforces good practices for production

# Core Components: 

- _config/ 
    Turns out anything beyond minimal needs basic configurations. Any .ini files in this directory will be 
    converted to a global constant
    
- base/
- default/



#TODO: 

- WTF is up with Client? 
- Better Access Control  - fix up Whitelist & Restricted
