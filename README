ZERO CORE: 

Version 3.0.1


The purpose of this framework is to get the fuck out of the way and let you get some fucking work done. 
Too many frameworks out there make up rules and make you learn how to do new things. 
This framework aims to be much simpler. 

Write a class. Give it a method. 

When you go to 

yourdomain.com/yourClass/methodName

It fires the function defined, and returns the appropriate response, be it JSON, XML, or HTML. 



INSTALLATION

Fill out the shit in _/config/


USAGE

new Application(); 

That's it. 

Now, get to work.
