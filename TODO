Request/Response need better ways to determine ajax vs not ajax... 
also would like to include something that gives the JSON/AJAX response for good ol 
curl requests... 

API 
- requires some PDO something or another first... 
- get the service (url, key) from the database
- provide some backend for managing data providers. 
- do the right curl... (( TODO - maybe need get/post column ))
